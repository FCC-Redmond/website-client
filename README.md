# ASSIGNMENT 1: HTML
1. Clone the repo to your local repository
2. Create a new branch with your name and an incrementer. Ex. ak-1
3. Create an html file in '/members' with your name as the file name. Ex. amber-kim.html
4. Create your html scaffold (See the wireframes).
5. Add in your content and image.
6. No CSS or styling just yet so your page won't look like the wireframes yet, but it needs to have the right order.
7. Add, commit, push.
8. Pull request to your FORK's master when your page is ready.

# ASSIGNMENT 2: CSS
1. Create your own .css file under '/members/css'. Name your css file with the same name as your html file. So amber-kim.html would be amber-kim.css
2. Read https://smacss.com/
3. Read https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
3. You won't be separating everything in different .css files, but you can practice in your own .css files under '/member' by separating your categories using CSS comments.
4. Design ONLY for mobile for now. See the 'wireframes/fcc-redmond-profile-wireframe.png' file
5. You may use your own colors, fonts, etc.
6. The wireframes are a starting point. You don't have to build it exactly.
